# trace4harmonization

## Description
Harmonize numerical values extracted from medical images (e.g. acquired with different models of image-acquisition system)

## Usage
Example of run for the **calibration stage** (training):
`jobman submit -i trace4harmonization -- -- OPERATION=calibrate WORKDIR=~/persistent-home/trace4harmonization TRAINING_CALIBRATION_FILENAME=harmonization_training.csv`

And an example of run for the **application stage**:
`jobman submit -i trace4harmonization -- -- OPERATION=apply WORKDIR=~/persistent-home/trace4harmonization CLASSIFICATION_APPLY_FILENAME=file_to_be_harmonized.csv`

Note the "WORKDIR" (working directory) path have to be within the persistent-home, which is shared between all desktops and jobs created by the user, in that working directory should be any input file (the calibration file and the file to be harmonized in the "application stage").
