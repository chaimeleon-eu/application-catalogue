# t2w-prostate-segmentation-tool

## Description
Prostate segmentation on a T2w sequence.

## Usage
Two arguments are required:
 - `-i <input_dir>`: directory to a T2w DICOM folder
 - `-o <output_dir>`: directory to store results

Example of usage:
`jobman submit -i t2w-prostate-segmentation-tool -- -i ~/datasets/dc0dbf84-ebcf-470a-8b45-ef682ddafc6c -o ~/persistent-home/t2w-prostate-segmentation-tool`

Note the output directory path should be any within the persistent-home, which is shared between all desktops and jobs created by the user, 
otherwise the results will be lost after the end of the job.
